kiota is an apartment-hunting app designed for people living in Tokyo, Japan. With kiota, finding an apartment has never been easier or more fun.

It makes use of an engaging series of questions to gauge what is most important to the user. Then, in 'Tinder-like' style it presents the user with a series of properties they may choose to 'swipe right' or 'swipe-left' on.

Once they have selected their favorites, the user can then get into contact with the property owner or real estate agent to set up a time and place to view the properties they like.

kiota uses many technologies, mainly Ruby on Rails but also Javascript, Active Record database management, Bootstrap and CSS. Designed primarily for mobile applications.
